This repository is a simple starting point for developing TradingView Pine Script algorithms. It provides a place to store your scripts locally and keep them versioned with Git.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository or create a new project based on it.
2. Create or edit your Pine Script files in the `scripts/` directory of this repo. Examples are provided to help you get started.
3. Open [TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/) and navigate to the Pine Script editor. Copy the contents of your local file into the editor to run and test your script.

## Pine Script Documentation

TradingView maintains comprehensive documentation for Pine Script. Visit the official docs to learn about the language and available functions:

- [Pine Script v5 User Manual](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/en/v5/)

These docs include tutorials, language references, and plenty of example indicators.

## Directory Layout

- `scripts/` &ndash; Place your `.pine` strategy and indicator files here. The repository contains an example indicator to demonstrate basic usage.

## Example Indicator

The `scripts/simple_sma_indicator.pine` file implements a minimal moving average indicator. You can load it into TradingView to see how it works. Modify it or create new files under `scripts/` for your own strategies.

## Saving New Scripts

1. Inside this repository, create a file in the `scripts/` directory with the extension `.pine`.
2. Write or paste your Pine Script code into that file.
3. Commit the file to keep track of your changes.
4. To test the script, copy its contents into the Pine Script editor on TradingView.

Happy coding!
